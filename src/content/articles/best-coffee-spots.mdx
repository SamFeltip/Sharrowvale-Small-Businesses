Based in Dyson Place, Cornerstone thrives out of a converted barn, running as a spacious and classy space to eat, drink and relax nestled in the Dyson Place courtyard. 

Despite it's broad appeal the Coffee was still superb with zero compromise on the taste or texture. Making the most of the menu we also tired some of their chips which were a great addition after a long day.

The atmosphere is also great, with two floors of varied seating ideal for groups, prams and pets or those looking for a laptop friendly place to be mid-week.
