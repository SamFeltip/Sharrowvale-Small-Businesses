Cask and Keg No. 3 is the new kid on the block at Sharrow Vale. Openning on Thursday, 7th of November at 3pm, we can't wait to see what this new bar has to offer!

Cask and Keg aren't afraid to make an impression. With their bright blue storefront, we're sure they will be a fantastic addition to Sharrow Vale's already vibrant pub and bar scene.
