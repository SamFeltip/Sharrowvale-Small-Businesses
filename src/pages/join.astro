                    <H2>Our Vision</H2>
                    <p>
                        Our vision is to help grow and support small businesses
                        in Sharrow Vale.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As locals we love the unique collection of shops in the
                        Vale and see that a central website would improve the
                        accessibility of the shops and services available,
                        making it easy for locals and visitors to easily search
                        and see what's on offer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To support this we'll be maintaining and growing the
                        site as well as providing regular web articles like:
                        'Top 5 places to grab a drink in Sheffield this Summer'
                        or 'Best places to get graduation gifts in Sheffield'
                        which continue to bring new traffic to the site and to
                        the businesses on it. This alongside promotion at events
                        like the markets will help lead local people to consider
                        Sharrow Vale as the place to go for their local needs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There's lots of ways we could develop this site but for
                        now we're not looking to replace any existing sites,
                        just looking for businesses that want to partner with us
                        in boosting business in the area.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This site is not a replacement of the Sharrow Vale
                        Community Association but we are aspiring to partner
                        with them.
