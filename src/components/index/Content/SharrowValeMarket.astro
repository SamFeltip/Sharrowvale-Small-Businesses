            Sharrow Vale Market is one of the Sharrows most beloved features,
            running three times a year from Hunters Bar roundabout all the way
            down Stewart road.
        </P>
        <P weight="light">
            The market hosts around 100 stalls selling a wide variety of locally
            reared and home made produce as well as hot food, crafts, clothing
            and plants. In addition to the stalls, most of the shops, pubs and
            cafes are also open on market days.
