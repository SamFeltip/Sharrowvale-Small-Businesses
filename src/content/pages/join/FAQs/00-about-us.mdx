preview: Who are you?

Hi! We're Dan & Sam. After studying in Sheffield we've now made a life here working in website development and marketing. We're not business men, just local guys with a passion for helping out the community and supporting local. We met at The Well Church over 5 years ago as students and now live together with friends in Sharrow.
