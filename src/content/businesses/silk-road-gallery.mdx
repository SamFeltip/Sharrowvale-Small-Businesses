Silk Road Gallery is a tucked away spot on Sharrow Vale where each item tells its own story. Run by Peter Bennion and Kay Wallace, 
the gallery is not just a collection of great art pieces and textiles — it offers a look into the cultures of India, Tibet, and 
beyond.

What makes the gallery special is the personal touch behind every object. Each vintage textile, hand-carved figure, or striking 
photograph comes with a story of adventure. The couple's trips to markets and historic sites turn everyday finds into keepsakes that
let you experience a bit of far-off lands right here in Sheffield.

For a closer look at their story, visit the Silk Road Gallery website and check out their blog post “Wildlife Paintings from Ladakh.” 
The article is a refreshing read that highlights their art collection and show's Peter & Key's passion for Indian culture. 

Follow the signs to Silk Road Gallery and you'll discover a variety of pieces at this local gallery — from fabrics and carvings 
to art and photos that capture the spirit of India. Silk Road's connection to India's lively markets and ancient sites is clear in 
it's vibrant collection, and is well worth a visit next time you're at the vale.
