New kid on the block Porter Coffee serves some of the best coffee on The Vale. 

Located towards the top of Sharrow vale Road, Porter Coffee prioritises high-quality coffee making and artisanal bakes and bites to make a top spot for a brew.

Ben, the owner, set up shop in September 2024 and quickly found success with locals looking to catch-up with a friend or visitors looking to take a break. It’s cool but cosy atmosphere is comfortable and clean; accompanied by light indie background music, free Wifi and comfortable seating. 

The food was an added bonus, with plenty of lunch and breakfast options like baked goods, sarnies and freshly made hot food. The bacon, egg and cheese brioche bun we had was top-tier and reasonable at only £6.50.

Based in Dyson Place, Cornerstone thrives out of a converted barn, running as a spacious and classy space to eat, drink and relax nestled in the Dyson Place courtyard. 

Despite it's broad appeal the Coffee was still superb with zero compromise on the taste or texture. Making the most of the menu we also tired some of their chips which were a great addition after a long day.

The atmosphere is also great, with two floors of varied seating ideal for groups, prams and pets or those looking for a laptop friendly place to be mid-week.
