Silk Road Gallery is a tucked away spot on Sharrow Vale where each item tells its own story. Run by Peter Bennion and Kay Wallace, 
the gallery is not just a collection of great art pieces and textiles — it offers a look into the cultures of India, Tibet, and 
beyond.

What makes the gallery special is the personal touch behind every object. Each vintage textile, hand-carved figure, or striking 
photograph comes with a story of adventure. The couple's trips to markets and historic sites turn everyday finds into keepsakes that
let you experience a bit of far-off lands right here in Sheffield.

For a closer look at their story, visit the Silk Road Gallery website and check out their blog post [Wildlife Paintings from Ladakh](https://silkroadgallery.co.uk/blogs/news/wildlife-paintings-from-ladakh).
The article is a refreshing read that highlights their art collection and show's Peter & Key's passion for Indian culture.
