				<h2>Our Vision</h2>
				<p>
					Our vision is to help grow and support small businesses in
					Sharrow Vale.
				</p>
				<p>
					As locals we love the unique collection of shops in the Vale
					and see that a central website would improve the
					accessibility of the shops and services available, making it
					easy for locals and visitors to easily search and see what's
					on offer.
				</p>
				<p>
					To support this we'll be maintaining and growing the site as
					well as providing regular web articles like: 'Top 5 places
					to grab a drink in Sheffield this Summer' or 'Best places to
					get graduation gifts in Sheffield' which continue to bring
					new traffic to the site and to the businesses on it. This
					alongside promotion at events like the markets will help
					lead local people to consider Sharrow Vale as the place to
					go for their local needs.
				</p>
				<p>
					There's lots of ways we could develop this site but for now
					we're not looking to replace any existing sites, just
					looking for businesses that want to partner with us in
					boosting business in the area.
				</p>
				<p>
					This site is not a replacement of the Sharrow Vale Community
					Association but we are aspiring to partner with them.
