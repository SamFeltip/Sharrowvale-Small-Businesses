New kid on the block Porter Coffee serves some of the best coffee on The Vale.

Located towards the top of Sharrow vale Road, Porter Coffee prioritises high-quality coffee making and artisanal bakes and bites to make a top spot for a brew.

Ben, the owner, set up shop in September 2024 and quickly found success with locals looking to catch-up with a friend or visitors looking to take a break. It's cool but cosy atmosphere is comfortable and clean; accompanied by light indie background music, free Wifi and comfortable seating.

The food was an added bonus, with plenty of lunch and breakfast options like baked goods, sarnies and freshly made hot food. The bacon, egg and cheese brioche bun we had was top-tier and reasonable at only £6.50.

Based in Dyson Place, Cornerstone thrives out of a converted barn, running as a spacious and classy space to eat, drink and relax nestled in the Dyson Place courtyard.

Despite it's broad appeal the Coffee was still superb with zero compromise on the taste or texture. Making the most of the menu we also tired some of their chips which were a great addition after a long day.

The atmosphere is also great, with two floors of varied seating ideal for groups, prams and pets or those looking for a laptop friendly place to be mid-week.

Tonco has the benefit of being a fully functioning indie bakery whilst also having the facilities that make it a great place to stop a while for a bite to eat and barista made brew.  

Set in an large, ex-industrial space, Tonco has a quirky aesthetic that matches it's unique position as a Cafe, Bakery and Shop selling a range of authentic, often locally produced produce. It has a good number of tables and space for WFH individuals, prams and group catch-ups. 

Staff were really friendly and the coffee and daily selection of sandwiches make Tonco one of the best all round places for a pit stop on Sharrow Vale indoors or outside in the summer months.

Located at the far end of the road, corner store has a good selection of coffees and pastries, but stands out for it's quirky feel, encaptulated in its white & pink aesthetic and range of products produced by local businesses such as independent syrups, snacks, chocolate, and even dried flowers from [Kohler](https://www.kohler-homeware.com/?fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAaYnnnhNzG9ZimZy2n46go_WPe0GENuppy_r-tdF3zV81UAEps-oHFzK1ZI_aem_bQvPg3XAxZnEhIbbI-CW-Q), an indie Sheffield florist.

Sometimes missed for being a bit out of the way, Corner store is the hidden gem that serves their coffee with a smile, it's quirky vibe and premium coffee is popular with those that take their coffee seriously; even the latte art is impressive. 

Note though that there's pretty limited seating, made up for by their smiley coffee cups, take away bakes and friendly staff. Check it out next time you're looking for a coffee on the go.
