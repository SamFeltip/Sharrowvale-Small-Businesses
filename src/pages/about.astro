                <h2>Our Vision</h2>
                <p>
                    Our vision is to help grow and support small businesses in
                    Sharrow Vale.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As locals we love the unique collection of shops in the Vale
                    and see that a central website would improve the
                    accessibility of the shops and services available, making it
                    easy for locals and visitors to easily search and see what's
                    on offer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To support this we'll be maintaining and growing the site as
                    well as providing regular web articles like: 'Top 5 places
                    to grab a drink in Sheffield this Summer' or 'Best places to
                    get graduation gifts in Sheffield' which continue to bring
                    new traffic to the site and to the businesses on it. This
                    alongside promotion at events like the markets will help
                    lead local people to consider Sharrow Vale as the place to
                    go for their local needs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There's lots of ways we could develop this site but for now
                    we're not looking to replace any existing sites, just
                    looking for businesses that want to partner with us in
                    boosting business in the area.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This site is not a replacement of the Sharrow Vale Community
                    Association but we are aspiring to partner with them.
