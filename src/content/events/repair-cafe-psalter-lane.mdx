## Repair Cafe

Back by popular demand, Psalter lane is hosting a Repair Caf√© in their church. With the help of volunteers, learn how to make
 repairs on your own items, from clothes to electronics, rather than throwing them away.

From 10am to 2pm, you can come down to Psalter lane church and learn how to repair your own goods. You can learn more about the event
 and what to expect on their [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/StAndrewsPsalterLaneChurch).

Psalter lane church is a big proponent of sustainability and reducing waste, and is part of the
 [echo group program](https://ecochurch.arocha.org.uk/) for churches, boasting a silver award! You can learn more about
 what they're doing to help the environment on their website [here](https://www.standrewspsalterlane.org.uk/our-community/ecogroup/).
