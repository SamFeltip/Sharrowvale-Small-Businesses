## Christmas market 2024

The Christmas market is a great way to get your Christmas wishes and gifts delivered to you. It's a great way to support local businesses and help them stay afloat during the holiday season.

## What to expect

Each year, the Sharrow Vale Community Association (SVCA) holds a Christmas Market in the town centre. It hosts over 100 stalls selling a wide variety of locally reared and home made produce as well as hot food, crafts, clothing, and more!

There's a collection of businesses, charities, and not-for-profit organisations that are part of the Christmas Market.

The Christmas market is held by the Sharrow Vale Community Association (SVCA) every December.
