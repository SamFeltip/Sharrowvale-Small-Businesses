Our philosophy is that there is no “one size fits all” and our aim is to give you the best possible advice for your particular event, race and running ambitions.
We'll have a chat about what you need, get a few choices out for you to try on the treadmill, look at how the shoes make you move ("gait analysis"), make sure the size and fit are right for you, and help you make an informed choice.
We provide you with the gear to enjoy your adventure!We are official stockist of major brands in running, including: Hoka, Brooks, Adidas, Saucony, Altra, La Sportiva, NNormal, VJ.
As an independent Sheffield store, we do what we can to support local events, such as the Round Sheffield Run, Sheffield 101010, Dig Deep and others.
We also help local running clubs with their events by providing race numbers or helping with prizes and sponsorship.
